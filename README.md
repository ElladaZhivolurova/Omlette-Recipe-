      <ul> 
        <li> 2 large eggs </li> 
        <li> Kosher salt </li>
        <li> Freshly ground black pepper </li> 
        <li> Pinch red pepper flakes </li>

  <h2> DIRECTIONS </h2> 

      <ol> 
        <li> In a medium bowl, beat eggs until no whites remain, then season with salt, 
             pepper, and a pinch red pepper flakes. </li> 
        <li> In a medium non-stick skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Pour in eggs and tilt pan so eggs fully cover the entire pan.
             As eggs start to set, use a rubber spatula to drag cooked edges into center of pan. 
            Tilt pan to let uncooked egg fall to the edge of the pan. </li>
        <li> Once the bottom is set, but top is still a little wet, sprinkle cheese and chives on one half of omelet. 
             Fold other side over cheese and slide omelet onto a plate. </li>
